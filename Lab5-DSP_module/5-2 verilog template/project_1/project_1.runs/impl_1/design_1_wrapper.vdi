WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP design_1_i/dsp_direct_0/inst/DSP48E1_inst output design_1_i/dsp_direct_0/inst/DSP48E1_inst/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPREG-4] DSP48E1_PregDynOpmodeZmuxP:: The DSP48E1 cell design_1_i/dsp_direct_0/inst/DSP48E1_inst with the given dynamic OPMODE[6:0] connections may lead to an unregistered asynchronous feedback path without the PREG attribute enabled. Please refer to the user guide and if one of the internal P feedback opmodes is possible for this design the PREG attribute must be set to 1, currently set to 0
WARNING: [DRC REQP-23] enum_AREG_1_connects_CEA2_connects_CEA2_GND: design_1_i/dsp_direct_0/inst/DSP48E1_inst: When the DSP48E1 AREG attribute is set to 1, the CEA2 input pin should be active or tied to VCC if the A&B bus is selected as an X MUX input, i.e. OPMODE0 and OPMODE1 are 1. Otherwise if CEA2 is GND, then the A segment of the A&B bus will always be zero.

Otherwise if CEB2 is GND, then the B segment of the A&B bus will always be zero.
